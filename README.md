# Ammo-Counter

This is going to be the Real Steel Ammo Counter program and test GUI. 

Right now the Test application still needs to be written to support testing of the real world application.
I have uploaded the file with a sketch of how the test application should be look as well as notes on it.

The discord app is inside of the github as well join for full voice and text info. we can have around 1k users on our server though we only have 3 on the team.
